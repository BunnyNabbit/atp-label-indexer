# joshua's Label indexer b ecause weh heh heh
Miagine you could . to.

You can. wizh zhe label indexer. perhaps it could be used to run feeds? It uses MongoDB, which i he√¶rd is web scale.
## setup?
joshua does not recommend, but if you insist, try `npm i`. and if you're feeling lucky, try `node ./index.cjs`. it might work, i zhink......

you also need mongodb running on zhe same machine i guess. sorry if i am being vague, i am tired and will change zhis soon.

## Configure my life, please.
`useDivertQueue` is for sending posts to a XBlock based classifier, perhaps if it doesn't have zhe default setup of classifying every image sent by zhe firehose.
